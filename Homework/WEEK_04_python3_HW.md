### Python 3 Homework


1. The python module `os` is very useful for interfacing with your computer's **o**perating **s**ystem. One useful function in this module is `os.listdir(<path_to_directory>)`, which lists the contents of a given directory.
Write a function called `find_text_files()` which takes a single argument (the name of a directory) and returns a **list** of all file names in that directory that have the extension `.txt`. For this, you'll also need to use the string method `.endswith()` (look it up to see how to use it!). Write a script which contains this function. When you run the script from the command line, the script should print "Your directory has \<n\> text files," where \<n\> is the number of files.

2. Open the script ["protein\_code.py"](protein_code.py). Create a new, clean version of this script called "protein\_code\_functions.py" which accomplishes the same exact same tasks as the original, except that the script has been cleanly separated into functions. The main body of the script script, break up the code into a total of **three** functions which the body of the script calls. The resulting script should accomplish the exact same tasks as the original script.
